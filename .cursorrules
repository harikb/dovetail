# Cursor Rules for Dovetail Project

## Shell Command Guidelines
- NEVER use exclamation marks (!) in echo statements or terminal commands
- Exclamation marks trigger shell history expansion and cause command failures
- Use periods, dashes, or other punctuation instead
- Example: Use "Phase 2 Complete." instead of "Phase 2 Complete!"
- CRITICAL: Always end sentences with periods, not exclamation marks in echo commands

## Code Style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Error Handling: Follow a "fail fast" principle.
  - Handle errors explicitly; do not hide them or let them fail silently.
  - Ensure tracebacks are always shown.

Do not use try/catch or recover (in Go) to suppress errors or to log-and-ignore.
## Testing
- Always test TUI changes with actual file comparisons
- Verify both keyboard navigation and visual output
- Check edge cases like empty directories or permission errors
